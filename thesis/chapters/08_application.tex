\chapter{Application}
\label{cha:application}

In this chapter, we illustrate how programmers can benefit from the different tools of the semantic workspace for augmenting typical exploratory activities.
To this end, we describe two scenarios: in the first one, a programmer uses semantic suggestions and semantic completions to prototype a GUI application.
In the second scenario, a programmer conducts a semantic conversation with a text object to explore its state, capabilities, and implementation details.
Finally, we describe how semantic conversations can be integrated more deeply into traditional exploratory programming systems by leveraging the object-oriented interfaces of existing programming tools.

\begin{summary}
	Through different scenarios, we have demonstrated how programmers can use semantic suggestions and completions to create prototypes without researching, assembling, and testing all required information on their own and how they can use semantic conversations to explore the state and behavior of objects through natural-language questions.
	We have illustrated that by generically enhancing existing programming tools with semantic object interfaces, we can allow programmers to access different artifacts in the programming systems in a more conceptual, high-level style.
