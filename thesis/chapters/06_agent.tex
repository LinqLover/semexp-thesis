\chapter{Building an Exploratory Programming Agent with GPT-4}
\label{cha:agent}

In this chapter, we describe our implementation of semantic object interfaces through a conversational autonomous agent.
In our prototype, we use OpenAI's LLM GPT-4\footnote{Used in the version \code{gpt-4-0125-preview}.}, which ranks among the most powerful models in several benchmarks regarding abilities such as problem solving, creative tasks, and code writing at the time of writing~\cite{borji2023battle,chiang2024chatbot}.
% todo: are these reasonable benchmarks?

We implement the agent's policies through prompt engineering and map the system interface to a set of tools for function calling.
Finally, we optimize the agent's performance for generating semantic code completions.

% todo: somewhere provide full prompt/conversation(s) (appendix?)

\begin{summary}
	We have implemented an exploratory programming agent for semantic object interfaces by \emph{prompting} a GPT-4 model with a set of behavioral policies and initial research steps, connecting it to the system through \emph{functions} for executing experiments, and pre-generating a statically structured prompt to efficiently generate code completions.
