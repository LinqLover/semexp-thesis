\chapter{Approach}
\label{cha:approach}

In this chapter, we introduce our model of an \emph{augmented exploratory programming workflow}.
This model integrates semantic technologies into exploratory programming systems to support programmers in their research process through more conceptual and contextual interfaces.
Second, we present our concept of a \emph{semantic workspace} that applies our workflow by defining three different kinds of novel \emph{semantic tools} for exploratory programming systems.

\begin{summary}
	We have proposed the \emph{augmented exploratory programming workflow} in which programmers collaborate on high-level steps of their research process with \emph{semantic exploratory programming systems}.
	These systems offer \emph{semantic interfaces} for exchanging conceptual artifacts with programmers and can \emph{anticipate} and \emph{augment} their workflow.
	Our \emph{semantic workspace} provides three tool concepts for such systems at different levels of support: \emph{semantic suggestions}, \emph{semantic completions}, and \emph{semantic conversations}.
