\section{Semantic Suggestions}
\label{sec:implementation/suggestions}

We implement semantic suggestions through a \emph{suggestion space} window that is placed as a vertical docking bar at the edge of the screen~(\cref{fig:implementation/suggestions/space}).
To track the experiments of programmers, we observe their mouse and keyboard focus by using Morphic's event filter mechanism.
From the focused windows, we extract the currently browsed classes and methods or drafted scripts and notes as input artifacts for the suggestion engine.

In the suggestion space, we display similar code and documentation artifacts, correlated code artifacts, and an optional summary.
Suggestions are updated continously in the background as the programmer conducts experiments by browsing methods or writing code or notes.

To enable semantic retrieval of all classes and methods in the image, we maintain either of them in a semantic corpus~(see \cref{sec:semtex/model/search}).
We subscribe to the \code{SystemChangeNotifier} interface to incoporate updates from the system.
We compute embeddings for new documents asynchronously in the background after the current world cycle has ended (i.e., \code{[aCorpus computeEmbeddings] future forkAt: Processor systemBackgroundPriority}).
This strategy allows for bulk-updating the corpus and avoiding the overhead of multiple requests to the OpenAI API after many code changes have been applied as part of a single operation (such as installing a package).
At the same time, corpus updates are run in the background without introducing noticable lags.
